# BrainAI
An end-to-end deep learning pipeline for classifying brain MRI images into tumorous and non-tumorous categories using transfer learning with VGG19. The project includes automated image preprocessing (contour-based cropping), dataset balancing through augmentation, multi-phase model training, and performance visualization.
